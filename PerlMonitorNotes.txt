Notes on structure of perl sensor-reading program
Line numbers (in parens) based on 485poll22.plx

uses some external packages:
	Term::ReadKey for live keypress detection
	POSIX "sus_wait_h" probably for threads
	threads("yield")
	threads::shared to share vars with threads
	Schedule::Cron for crontab-based sprinkler control
	Win32::SerialPort to talk to serial port

(25) Saves PID in a file for a watchdog

(48) Does inits for serial port

(90) Prints some initial messages

(123) Set RTS active for serial port direction control

(128) Main variable inits

(157) Start cron threads for sprinkler scheduler

(187) sub: lenOcChk  checks length, opcode of new message

(208) sub: logit logging function - main output to data file.  Is this still used?

(228) sub: logit2  - used?

(243) main block of per-sensor processing routines.  References to these subs are names $rainref for rain sensor.  Currently 10 are defined - not all used in production.

(565) open main data log file - some kind of option to open a test log file?

(596) Set up hash %sensors of metadata for each sensor:
	name
	addr
	poll rate
	kind of data returned (?)
	also hash of err counts
	
	This might be the place to start a morph to actual OO code?

(707) Set up array @names indexed by sensor addr for reverse lookup addr->name.

(716) MAIN POLL ONE SENSOR ROUTINE sub: pollit()  This sends poll messages out on the 485 bus.

(766) sub: checkit - validate received message

(842) sub: logRestart - log that a sensor restarted

(852) sub: logMsg - main data logger??

(867) sub: readit - MAIN READ ROUTINE - reads serial, handles valid, invalid responses, does retries, calls the sensor-specific handler in $sensors{sensor_name}

(962) MAIN LOOP
	- handle sprinkler cron job
	- loop thru all configured sensors using pollit, readit
	- check transport process, restart if needed (starts it initially?)
	- if time to update web site, send data
	- sleep with keyboard hot key checks - lots of code

(1347) sub: cronDispatch - dispatcher for cron process

(1359) main cron thread code

(1377) sub: shortTS - timestamp utility

(1390) SMS alert stuff to text me if sensors fail, etc

(1443) Transport child process code
	- (1447) transport main loop
